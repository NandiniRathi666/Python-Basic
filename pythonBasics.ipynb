        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
        "  - python is a  high level programming language,that is widely used in industries like data industries.\n",
        "  It is both object oriented and procedural oriented programming language.\n",
        "  it is easy to learn and understand the code.\n",
        "  it also has less syntax than other programming language making it user friendly.\n",
        "  It is popular because: it has lots of libraries like django,pandas,numpy,etc which makes it easier for user.we can also do data ananlysis using python.\n",
        "  it also helps in web development using python.\n",
        "  it is also used in automation industries.\n",
        "  also in maintaining databases.\n",
        "  it is also has huge active community,like it is used in almost big companies like google,netfkix,amazon for software davelopment and data analysis.\n",
        "  and also it is easy to learn.\n",
        "  2. What is an interpreter in Python\n",
        "  - python interpreter is a program that helps to convert python code into machine code,so that it is easy for development.\n",
        "  intepreter helps to convert code line by line rather than compling it all once so that it becomes easy fro users to debug the error.\n",
        "  3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
        "  - pre defined words are the special words in python language that holds a specific meaning in the language,these words are already defined,so that know one can use them,as the name of variables and functions,they are reseerved for python syntax and functionality. they are also known as reseved words.ex- for,while,true,false,else,break,import,continue,etc\n",
        "  4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
        "  - keyword are reserved words that has their own meaning,so by using them as the name of variables,it will create an issue in pythons syntax and hence will show an error,thats  why we can not use keywords as variable name.\n",
        "  5. What is mutability in Python\n",
        "  - In python mutablity means changeability of  any variable or object,that is the ability of a variable or object to change afterwards,for ex when we create a list we can change the contents of list.Dictionary is also mutable in python,we can also change its key,value.\n",
        "  6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
        "  - lists is mutable in python memaing it can change,grow,shrink. the mutability of the list is designed for ideal cases where the data needs to be frquently updated and managed for the easy access of the data but tuple are immutable that is that thay can not be changed,it is designed to ensure the data integrity,where in some cases no one else can chnage the data in order to maintain the integrity of data.\n",
        "  7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
        "  - \"==\"operator is a Relational operator,which is used to check if the given two conditions are equal.and \"is\" operator is Identity operator which is ussed to check whether 2 variables refer to same memory location.\n",
